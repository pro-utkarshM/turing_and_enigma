# Turing and Enigma: Turing Machine with Caesar Cipher

## Overview

This project simulates a Turing machine that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher (shift of 3).

### Features:
- **Turing Machine**: Simulates tape manipulation, state transitions, and head movement.
- **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypts and decrypts a message ("HELLO").

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pro-utkarshM
   cd turing_and_enigma
   ```

2. Compile:

   ```bash
   gcc main.c vm.c turing.c enigma.c -o vm
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   ./vm
   ```

### Example Output:

```
Encrypted: KHOOR
Decrypted: HELLO
```
